        <p class="text-justify">
          This site was made to work as an online portfolio for myself. I decided not to use any pre-made tool or online service to
          do this because I wanted to show my software development skills trhough this website. 
          <br><br>
          Like almost all software products that I worked on 
          were company owned, I had little work to show in details. No source codes, database models, etc. 
          <br><br>
          So, to portrait a little of my
          work experience and skills I built a solution composed of a Web front-end, a REST API for the back-end part and a mobile application. 
          The front-end was build using Angular, the back-end was build using java and the mobile app was build using native Android. 
          <br><br>
          The main intent of this entire solution is to demonstrate my abilities, putting together some of the technologies I've been working with. 
          Technological choices were not made considering the best architectural model, but the greater number of technical skills used.
